# Venom Binary Search Tree (Java, Data Structures)

A Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation in Java for managing custom `SymbioteHost` objects.  
This project was completed as part of a data structures course and demonstrates object-oriented design, recursion, and tree traversal algorithms.

## üß† Features
- Insert and search operations for `SymbioteHost` objects
- Recursive tree traversal methods
- Object-oriented design with custom comparison logic
- Demonstrates BST properties and algorithm efficiency

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview
- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts Used:** Binary Search Trees, Recursion, Object-Oriented Programming  
- **Topics:** Data Structures, Trees, Custom Object Comparison
